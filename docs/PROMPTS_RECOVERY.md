# Prompts Recovery

## Issue
During the initial migration to the improved folder structure, the `prompts.py` files were accidentally not migrated from the original structure. These files contained important prompt templates used by the MCP tools for better user experience.

## Resolution
The prompts have been recovered and properly integrated into the new structure with the following improvements:

### New Prompts Structure
```
src/snowflake_mcp/prompts/
├── __init__.py
├── object_prompts.py      # Object management prompt templates
├── sql_prompts.py         # SQL execution prompt templates
└── semantic_prompts.py    # Semantic view prompt templates
```

### Recovered Prompts

#### Object Management Prompts (`object_prompts.py`)
- `create_object_prompt(object_type)` - For creating Snowflake objects
- `drop_object_prompt(object_type)` - For dropping Snowflake objects  
- `create_or_alter_object_prompt(object_type)` - For updating or creating objects
- `describe_object_prompt(object_type)` - For describing object structure
- `list_objects_prompt(object_type)` - For listing objects

#### SQL Execution Prompts (`sql_prompts.py`)
- `query_tool_prompt` - For the main SQL query execution tool

#### Semantic View Prompts (`semantic_prompts.py`)
- `write_semantic_view_query_prompt` - For generating semantic view queries
- `query_semantic_view_prompt` - For executing semantic view queries

### Integration
The prompts have been properly integrated into the tools modules:

- `src/snowflake_mcp/tools/objects.py` - Now imports from `object_prompts`
- `src/snowflake_mcp/tools/sql.py` - Now imports from `sql_prompts`
- `src/snowflake_mcp/tools/semantic.py` - Now imports from `semantic_prompts`

### Benefits
1. **Centralized prompt management** - All prompts in one location
2. **Better organization** - Prompts grouped by functionality
3. **Improved maintainability** - Easier to update and modify prompts
4. **Consistent user experience** - Proper tool descriptions for MCP clients

## Status
✅ **Fully resolved** - All prompts have been recovered and integrated into the new structure with proper imports and functionality verified.
